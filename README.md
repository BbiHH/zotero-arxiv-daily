## 🚀 Usage
### Quick Start
1. Fork (and star😘) this repo.
![fork](./assets/fork.png)

2. Set Github Action environment variables.
![secrets](./assets/secrets.png)

Below are all the secrets you need to set. They are invisible to anyone including you once they are set, for security.

| Key |Description | Example |
| :---  | :---  | :--- |
| ZOTERO_ID  | User ID of your Zotero account. **User ID is not your username, but a sequence of numbers**Get your ID from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security). You can find it at the position shown in this [screenshot](https://github.com/TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily/blob/main/assets/userid.png). | 12345678  |
| ZOTERO_KEY | An Zotero API key with read access. Get a key from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security).  | AB5tZ877P2j7Sm2Mragq041H   |
| SENDER | The email account of the SMTP server that sends you email. | abc@qq.com |
| SENDER_PASSWORD | The password of the sender account. Note that it's not necessarily the password for logging in the e-mail client, but the authentication code for SMTP service. Ask your email provider for this.   | abcdefghijklmn |
| RECEIVER | The e-mail address that receives the paper list. | abc@outlook.com |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | API Key when using the API to access LLMs. You can get FREE API for using advanced open source LLMs in [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/b3XhBRAm). | sk-xxx |
| OPENAI_API_BASE | API URL when using the API to access LLMs. | https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1 |

Then you should also set a public variable `CUSTOM_CONFIG` for your custom configuration.
![vars](./assets/repo_var.png)
![custom_config](./assets/config_var.png)
Paste the following content into the value of `CUSTOM_CONFIG` variable:
```yaml
zotero:
  user_id: ${oc.env:ZOTERO_ID}
  api_key: ${oc.env:ZOTERO_KEY}
  include_path: null # Or e.g. ["2026/survey/**", "2026/reading-group/**"]
  ignore_path: null
  collection_priority: null # Or [{pattern: "research/recent-focus/**", weight: 3}, {pattern: "research/important/**", weight: 2}, {pattern: "research/to-read/**", weight: 1}]

email:
  sender: ${oc.env:SENDER}
  receiver: ${oc.env:RECEIVER}
  smtp_server: smtp.qq.com

      Focus on multimodal and large vision-language model reasoning, especially work
      that studies how models use, inspect, or reason with visual information.
    screening_requirements: |
      Prefer papers with a clear problem, concrete method, and meaningful findings.
      Deprioritize weakly related applications and vague incremental work.

source:
  arxiv:
    category: ["cs.AI","cs.CV","cs.LG","cs.CL"]
    include_cross_list: false # Set to true to include arXiv cross-list papers in these categories.
    # Optional: override retry/timeout defaults for slow remote runners.
    # network:
    #   read_timeout: 120
    #   max_attempts: 8

executor:
  debug: ${oc.env:DEBUG,null}
  source: ['arxiv']
```
Set `source.arxiv.include_cross_list: true` if you want cross-listed papers included.
>[!NOTE]
> `${oc.env:XXX,yyy}` means the value of the environment variable `XXX`. If the variable is not set, the default value `yyy` will be used.

arXiv RSS remains the source of the daily paper IDs. RSS, metadata API, and
full-text downloads all use explicit connection/read timeouts and retry
transient timeouts, connection failures, HTTP 408/429, and common 5xx responses
inside the same Action run. Retries use capped exponential backoff and honor a
numeric `Retry-After` header. If an API batch is incomplete, only the missing
IDs are requested again; after retries are exhausted, successfully retrieved
papers continue through the pipeline. The scheduled workflow has an explicit
330-minute job limit, leaving margin below GitHub's six-hour hosted-runner cap.

```

`zotero.include_path` and `zotero.ignore_path` still decide which Zotero papers
enter the interest corpus. When `zotero.collection_priority` is `null` or empty,
all filtered papers form one group and their similarities are averaged equally;
`dateAdded` is not used for ranking. When priority rules are configured, each
matched collection is averaged independently and those collection means are
combined with normalized weights, so a large collection does not gain influence
merely by containing more papers. A paper matching multiple rules is assigned
only to the highest-weight rule; equal weights are resolved by configuration
order. Unmatched papers do not enter priority scoring, and an all-unmatched
configuration raises a clear error.

The local reranker runs on CPU in GitHub Actions and does not require an
embedding API key. The daily and debug workflows cache Hugging Face model files.
Existing configurations using only `reranker.local.encode_kwargs` remain valid:
those shared options apply to both query and document encoding, while the new
side-specific options take precedence.

When `llm.filter.enabled` is true, the embedding-ranked candidates are split
into deterministic batches and scored on an absolute 0-100 scale. The model
returns only an ID-to-score JSON object; titles are never used to associate a
response with a paper. Every batch is rejected and retried if an ID is missing,
unknown, duplicated, or paired with an invalid score. A batch that still fails
after all retries falls back to embedding order instead of dropping papers.
The validated LLM score and the embedding-rank percentile are combined using
`llm.filter.weights`, then only `output_paper_num` papers continue to TLDR
generation and email rendering. Edit `research_profile`,
`screening_requirements`, or `prompt_file` to change the selection policy
without modifying Python code. Filtering reuses the same `llm.api` client and
inherits the model and other defaults from `llm.generation_kwargs`; its nested
`generation_kwargs` only overrides request parameters needed for scoring. The
candidate limit is controlled only by `executor.max_paper_num`; `batch_size`
controls request size but does not introduce a second candidate cap.

Only metadata is retrieved before embedding and LLM selection. Full text is
downloaded and extracted after selection, so expensive TeX/HTML/PDF processing
is limited to the final email set. The TLDR and affiliation calls each retry
transient or invalid responses up to their configured `max_attempts`.

Embedding vectors are cached by backend, model, query/document encoding
options, endpoint, and complete paper text. Unchanged Zotero papers therefore
skip repeated encoding on later runs, while a model, prompt, endpoint, or text
change automatically produces a cache miss. The local SQLite cache is stored in
`reranker.embedding_cache.directory`; both GitHub Actions workflows persist that
directory across runs. Cache read/write failures fall back to normal embedding
calculation and do not block the daily digest.

The email has a minimal plain-text body containing the local date and retrieval
status/count, plus the canonical digest as a dated UTF-8 `.md` attachment. The
digest is also written to `executor.markdown_output_dir` and uploaded by GitHub
Actions as a 30-day artifact, which makes it easy to open locally or pass to
another LLM.

Recoverable warnings and errors raised before email delivery are summarized in
the status body. Diagnostics are deduplicated, length- and count-limited, and
configured Zotero/LLM/embedding/email secrets are redacted. Fatal failures that
prevent the send step itself remain visible in the GitHub Actions log.

That's all! Now you can test the workflow by manually triggering it:
![test](./assets/test.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Test-Workflow Action is the debug version of the main workflow (Send-emails-daily), which always retrieve 5 arxiv papers regardless of the date. While the main workflow will be automatically triggered everyday and retrieve new papers released yesterday. There is no new arxiv paper at weekends and holiday, in which case you may see "No new papers found" in the log of main workflow.

Then check the log and the receiver email after it finishes.

By default, the main workflow runs on 22:00 UTC everyday. You can change this time by editting the workflow config `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### Local Running
Supported by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), this workflow can easily run on your local device if uv is installed:
```bash
# set all the environment variables
# export ZOTERO_ID=xxxx
# ...
cd zotero-arxiv-daily
uv run src/zotero_arxiv_daily/main.py
```

## 📖 How it works
*Zotero-arXiv-Daily* retrieves the Zotero interest corpus and the previous day's
paper metadata, then embeds each paper's complete title plus abstract. By
default, a candidate's score is its mean similarity to the filtered Zotero
corpus. With collection priority configured, similarities are averaged within
each collection first and then combined by normalized collection weights. The
optional LLM filter turns the embedding Top 100 into a smaller set such as Top
30. Only those selected papers are downloaded for full-text extraction, Chinese
TLDR generation, affiliation extraction, and Markdown email delivery.

## 📌 Limitations
- The recommendation algorithm is very simple, it may not accurately reflect your interest. Welcome better ideas for improving the algorithm!
- High `MAX_PAPER_NUM` can lead the execution time exceed the limitation of Github Action runner (6h per execution for public repo, and 2000 mins per month for private repo). Commonly, the quota given to public repo is definitely enough for individual use. If you have special requirements, you can deploy the workflow in your own server, or use a self-hosted Github Action runner, or pay for the exceeded execution time.
